The Agat (Russian: â†Šfd74
1983. These were based around a 6502 and were nominally Apple II-compatible
although with enough differences to be problematic.

They could use either standard Apple II 140kB disks, or a proprietary 840kb
MFM-based double-sided format. FluxEngine supports both of these; this profile
is for the proprietary format. for the Apple II format, use the `apple2`
profile.
