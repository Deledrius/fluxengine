# Roland D20

The Roland D20 is a classic electronic synthesiser with a built-in floppy
drive, used for saving MIDI sequences and samples.

Weirdly, it seems to use precisely the same format as the Brother word
processors: a thoroughly non-IBM-compatible custom GCR system.

FluxEngine pretends to support this, but it has had almost no testing, the only
disk image I have seen for it was mostly corrupt, and very little is known
about the format, so I have no idea whether it's correct or not.

Please [get in touch](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/issues/new) if
you know anything about it.
