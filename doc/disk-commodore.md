# Commodore 8-bit family

Commodore 64 disks come in two varieties: GCR, which are the overwhelming
majority; and MFM, only used on the 1571 and 1581. The latter were (as far as I
can tell) standard IBM PC format disks with a slightly odd sector count.

The GCR disks are much more interesting. They could store 170kB on a
single-sided disk (although later drives were double-sided), using a proprietary
encoding and record scheme; like [Apple Macintosh disks](macintosh.md) they
stored varying numbers of sectors per track to make the most of the physical
disk area, although unlike them they did it by changing the bitrate rather than
adjusting the motor speed.

The drives were also intelligent and ran DOS on a CPU inside them. The
computer itself knew nothing about file systems. You could even upload
programs onto the drive and run them there, allowing all sorts of custom disk
formats, although this was mostly used to compensate for the [cripplingly
slow connection to the
computer](https://ilesj.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/1541-why-so-complicated/) of
300 bytes per second (!). (The drive itself could transfer data reasonably
quickly.)

A standard 1541 disk has 35 tracks of 17 to 21 sectors, each 256 bytes long
(sometimes 40 tracks).

A standard 1581 disk has 80 tracks and two sides, each with 10 sectors, 512
bytes long.
