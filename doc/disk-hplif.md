# a variety of disk formats used by HP

LIF, a.k.a. Logical Interchange Format, is a series of formats used by
Hewlett-Packard across their entire range of computers, from calculators to
modern servers. It also defines a simple non-hierarchical filesystem which is
bizarrely _still_ supported by HP-UX systems.

Floppy-disk wise, they're yet more variations of the standard IBM floppy
encoding scheme.
