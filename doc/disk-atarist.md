# Atari ST family

Atari ST disks are standard MFM encoded IBM scheme disks without an IAM header.
Disks are typically formatted 512 bytes per sector with between 9-10 (sometimes
11!) sectors per track and 80-82 tracks per side.

For some reason, occasionally formatting software will put an extra IDAM record
with a sector number of 66 on a disk, which can horribly confuse things. The
Atari profiles below are configured to ignore these.

Be aware that many PC drives (including mine) won't do the 82 track formats.
