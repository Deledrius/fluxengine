# Acorn DFS fmaily

Acorn DFS disks are used by the Acorn Atom and BBC Micro series of computers.
They are pretty standard FM encoded IBM scheme disks, with 256-sectors and
0-based sector identifiers. There's nothing particularly special here.

DFS disks are all single-sided, but allow the other side of the disk to be
used as another volume.

They come in two varieties, 40 track and 80 track. These should both work.
Some rare disks are both at the same time. FluxEngine can read these but it
requires a bit of fiddling as they have the same tracks on twice.
