# BBC Micro, Archimedes

Acorn ADFS disks are used by the 6502-based BBC Micro and ARM-based Archimedes
series of computers. They are yet another variation on MFM encoded IBM scheme
disks, although with different sector sizes and with the 0-based sector
identifiers rather than 1-based sector identifiers. The index hole is ignored
and sectors are written whereever, requiring FluxEngine to do two revolutions
to read a disk.

There are various different kinds, which should all work out of the box.

Be aware that Acorn logical block numbering goes all the way up side 0 and
then all the way up side 1. However, FluxEngine uses traditional disk images
with alternating sides, with the blocks from track 0 side 0 then track 0 side
1 then track 1 side 0 etc. Most Acorn emulators will use both formats, but
they might require nudging as the side order can't be reliably autodetected.
