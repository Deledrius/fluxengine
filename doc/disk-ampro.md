# Ampro 5.25" family

The Ampro Little Board was a very simple and cheap Z80-based computer from
1984, which ran CP/M. It was, in fact, a single PCB which you could mount
on the bottom of a 5.25" drive.

[All about the Ampro Little Board](http://oldcomputers.net/ampro-little-board.html)

It stored either 400kB on a double-sided 40-track drive or 800kB on a
double-sided 80 track drive. The disk format it used was a slightly quirky
variation of the standard MFM IBM scheme --- sector numbering starts at 17
rather than 1 (or Acorn's 0). FluxEngine supports this.

FluxEngine has direct filesystem support for these disks, or you can pass the
disk images into [cpmtools](http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/):

$ cpmls -f ampdsdd ampro.img
