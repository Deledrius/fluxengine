This is a vary stripped down copy of the Anti-Grain Antialiasing graphics
rendering library --- I've removed all the platform-specific and control stuff
so that it can be used to generate memory images only.

The original AGG site is dead, so this version is cloned from
https://github.com/NNemec/antigrain.
